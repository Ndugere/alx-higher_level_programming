# Test cases for matrix_divided function

# Test Case 1: Divide a matrix by 3
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

# Test Case 2: Divide a matrix by 0 (should raise an exception)
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

# Test Case 3: Divide a matrix by 2.5
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2.5)
[[0.4, 0.8, 1.2], [1.6, 2.0, 2.4]]

# Test Case 4: Divide a matrix by a string (should raise an exception)
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, "test")
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: div must be a number

# Test Case 5: Matrix with rows of different sizes (should raise an exception)
>>> invalid_matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
>>> matrix_divided(invalid_matrix, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size
